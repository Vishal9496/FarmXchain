# FarmChainX

FarmChainX is a full-stack web application built to track agricultural produce from the farm to the consumer. The goal of the project is to improve transparency and traceability in the agricultural supply chain by recording each step a product goes through.

The system allows farmers, distributors, and retailers to add and view information about agricultural batches. Consumers can see the complete journey of a product and verify its origin.

## How the Project Works

1. A farmer registers a produce batch with basic details like crop type and harvest date.
2. Images of produce can be uploaded and stored securely.
3. Each transfer in the supply chain is recorded as an event.
4. The backend stores all data and exposes APIs to the frontend.
5. The frontend displays the complete traceability timeline to users.
